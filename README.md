# RegChecker
Check certain registry entries to remove ones that should not be there

Currently have it reading whatever registry keys I need to read, as well as parsing .reg files. 
Plan on making something like regshot as well into this while I have all of the registry stuff in here,
regshot keeps crashing on me :(

Currently a work in progress - have been steadily working on this but have been transitioning towards other things.
